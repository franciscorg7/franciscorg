  "description": "Master's in Computer Science specializing in Data Mining. My academic journey consolidated a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and computational complexity—foundations that I still apply today in designing scalable solutions and optimizing performance. In parallel, I developed transversal skills ranging from low-level programming to distributed systems and Artificial Intelligence, which reinforced my ability to adapt to different tech stacks. Above all, the greatest legacy from the Faculty of Sciences is my problem-solving mindset, a rigorous analytical approach that allows me to decompose complex challenges and find effective solutions, regardless of the technology."
